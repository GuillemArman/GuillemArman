I have worked on this team as a manager, making sure we were achieveng every milestone on time and that everybody was working. In order to do this we used Trello to distribute and control the tasks, also with help of microsoft excel. To communicate with the teams we used Discord and Whatsapp.

Here are some screenshots of the tools I just mentioned while we were working:

I also recorded all the meetings in a word. Check all the meetings information [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjsDI6wrHsJFBWOjpigXHiGC8xT_mEdfirNKqh5MNdA/edit)

I also implemented Brofiler.

## A Dream to the Past

I started the project working on the wiki. 
I was the responsible of choosing what audio would be on the game. From themes to fx.
On the design part I designed and tiled the overworld map despite of we decided not to include it at the end. Here there is a picture of it:

I also contribute to the dungeons design and creating the first maps with tiled.
I was the responsible of balancing the levels too (where I spend most of the time).

I worked on some animations that we also haven't include such as: Dying animation, Waking up animation and Sleeping animation.
